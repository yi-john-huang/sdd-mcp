The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.6.1] - 2025-10-30

### Changed
- **Documentation**: Updated README.md with v1.6.0 architecture refactoring information
  - Added v1.6.0 announcement highlighting 5 focused services
  - Updated version references from 1.4.5 to 1.6.0 in Quick Start examples
  - Emphasized scored semantic detection and improved maintainability

## [1.6.0] - 2025-10-30

### Changed
- **Architecture Refactoring**: Decomposed `RequirementsClarificationService` from "God Class" into focused, single-responsibility services following Domain-Driven Design principles
  - **SteeringContextLoader**: Pure I/O service for loading steering documents from filesystem
  - **DescriptionAnalyzer**: Pure analysis service using scored semantic detection (0-100 per category)
  - **QuestionGenerator**: Pure transformation service generating questions from analysis + configuration
  - **AnswerValidator**: Pure validation service with security checks
  - **DescriptionEnricher**: Pure synthesis service for 5W1H-structured descriptions
  - **RequirementsClarificationService**: Now acts as thin orchestrator delegating to specialized services
- **Improved Analysis**: Replaced brittle boolean regex matching with scored semantic detection
  - Each 5W1H category now scored 0-100 based on keyword density and coverage
  - Boolean presence derived from scores (threshold: 30%)
  - New score fields in `ClarificationAnalysis`: `whyScore`, `whoScore`, `whatScore`, `successScore`
  - Reduces false positives/negatives from simple pattern matching
- **Externalized Configuration**: Moved all question templates to `clarification-questions.ts`
  - Stable semantic IDs: `why_problem`, `why_value`, `who_users`, `what_mvp_features`, etc.
  - Each template includes: question, rationale, examples, required flag, condition function
  - Enables adding new questions without code changes
  - Better separation of business rules from service logic

### Added
- **New Domain Types**: 
  - `SteeringContext`: Moved to domain types for reusability across services
  - `DescriptionComponents`: Structured 5W1H components for enriched descriptions
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: 
  - 15 tests for DescriptionAnalyzer (scored semantic detection)
  - 8 tests for QuestionGenerator (template-based generation)
  - 11 tests for AnswerValidator (validation + security)
  - 10 tests for DescriptionEnricher (5W1H synthesis)
  - 13 tests for SteeringContextLoader (I/O with error handling)
  - 5 tests for RequirementsClarificationService (orchestration)
  - Total: 62 new unit tests, all passing

### Technical Improvements
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each service has one clear purpose with focused interface
- **Dependency Injection**: All new services registered in DI container with proper type bindings
- **Error Handling**: SteeringContextLoader differentiates file-level errors (debug) from system errors (warn)
- **Testability**: Pure functions enable fast, isolated unit tests without mocks
- **Maintainability**: Services average ~100 LOC vs previous ~500 LOC monolith
- **Type Safety**: All services fully typed with readonly interfaces for immutability

### Migration Notes
- **Breaking Change**: `RequirementsClarificationService` constructor signature changed
  - Old: `constructor(fileSystem: FileSystemPort, logger: LoggerPort)`
  - New: `constructor(logger, steeringLoader, analyzer, questionGenerator, answerValidator, enricher)`
  - **Impact**: Direct instantiation requires all 6 dependencies
  - **Mitigation**: Use DI container (`container.get(TYPES.RequirementsClarificationService)`) - no code changes needed
- **API Compatibility**: Public methods unchanged - `analyzeDescription()`, `validateAnswers()`, `synthesizeDescription()` work identically
- **Test Updates**: Tests now mock specialized services instead of filesystem - see updated test file for examples

## [1.5.1] - 2025-10-30

### Fixed
- **Enhanced Input Validation**: `validateAnswers` now checks for empty/too-short answers (< 10 chars) and potentially malicious content (XSS patterns)
  - Returns detailed `AnswerValidationResult` with `tooShort` and `containsInvalidContent` arrays
  - Prevents security issues from user-provided clarification answers
- **Improved Error Handling**: `loadSteeringContext` now properly handles failures and always returns valid defaults
  - Individual try-catch blocks for product.md and tech.md loading
  - Better error logging with debug-level messages for individual file failures
  - Guaranteed non-null return value
- **Code Quality Improvements**: Extracted magic numbers and duplicated patterns to constants
  - Created `clarification-constants.ts` with `QUALITY_SCORE_WEIGHTS`, `ANSWER_VALIDATION`, `PATTERN_DETECTION`, `AMBIGUOUS_TERMS`
  - Replaced inline regex patterns with pre-compiled constants for better performance
  - All scoring thresholds now configurable in one place
- **Stable Question IDs**: Replaced UUID-based IDs with semantic identifiers
  - Question IDs: `why_problem`, `why_value`, `who_users`, `what_mvp_features`, `what_out_of_scope`, `success_metrics`, `how_tech_constraints`, `ambiguity_1-3`
  - Predictable IDs improve testability and debugging
- **Jest Module Resolution**: Fixed `moduleNameMapper` pattern to properly resolve `.js` imports to TypeScript source files
  - Pattern now correctly handles all relative imports without catching node_modules

### Changed
- **Type Safety**: Moved `ClarificationAnswers` and `AnswerValidationResult` to domain types for better reusability
- **Test Coverage**: Updated tests to verify new validation fields (`tooShort`, `containsInvalidContent`)
- **Build Configuration**: All 16 tests passing with TypeScript compilation successful

### Technical
- **Maintainability**: Reduced code duplication across service, adapter, and MCP server
- **Security**: Added XSS pattern detection for user-provided answers
- **Performance**: Pre-compiled regex patterns reduce repeated compilation overhead
- **Configuration**: Centralized constants allow easy tuning of quality thresholds

## [1.5.0] - 2025-10-30

### Added
- **Interactive Requirements Clarification**: New `RequirementsClarificationService` that analyzes project descriptions and blocks vague requirements

  - Context-aware question generation using existing `.kiro/steering/` documents to avoid redundancy
  - Two-pass workflow: analyze → return questions → validate answers → synthesize enriched description
- **Enhanced sdd-init Tool**: Interactive clarification flow with blocking mechanism
  - First pass: Analyzes description quality, returns clarification questions if score < 70%
  - Second pass: Validates answers, synthesizes enriched description with structured 5W1H format
  - Enriched descriptions include: Original, Business Justification (Why), Target Users (Who), Core Features (What), Technical Approach (How), Success Criteria
  - New `clarificationAnswers` parameter for second-pass submission
- **Comprehensive Type System**: New domain types for clarification workflow

- **Ambiguous Language**: Detects and clarifies non-specific terms before they cause scope issues

### Technical
- **Architecture**: Follows Domain-Driven Design with service in application layer
- **Integration**: Works in both simplified (mcp-server.js) and TypeScript (SDDToolAdapter) implementations
