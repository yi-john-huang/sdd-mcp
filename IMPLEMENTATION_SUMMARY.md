# MCP Tools Alignment with Kiro Workflow - Implementation Summary

## Problem Addressed
The MCP SDD tools were generating static template content instead of project-specific content, and relied on existing files (package.json) which failed for brand new projects. The user identified that `sdd-init` should be able to generate specs from empty projects and build from scratch, following the same workflow as the kiro commands.

## Solution Overview
Completely restructured the MCP tools to align with the kiro command workflow, enabling bootstrap functionality from minimal information and eliminating dependency on existing project files.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Workflow Transformation
**Before**: Static templates + package.json dependency
**After**: Dynamic generation from project description + phased workflow

### 2. Tool Input Changes
- **sdd-init**: `projectName + path` → `description` (text)
- **sdd-requirements/design/tasks**: `projectId` → `featureName` 

### 3. Phase Validation Implementation
```
sdd-init → sdd-requirements → sdd-design → sdd-tasks → implementation
     ↓           ↓               ↓            ↓
  initialized  requirements-  design-    tasks-generated
               generated      generated   (ready_for_implementation)
```

### 4. Spec Management System
- Created `.kiro/specs/[feature-name]/` structure
- Added `spec.json` for phase tracking and metadata
- Implemented approval workflow tracking

## Technical Implementation

### New Helper Functions
- `generateFeatureName(description)` - Extract concise name from description  
- `ensureUniqueFeatureName(baseName)` - Handle naming conflicts
- `loadSpecContext(featureName)` - Load spec files for context
- `generateEARSRequirements(description)` - Create EARS-formatted criteria
- Various description analysis functions

### Updated Tool Handlers
1. **handleInitSimplified**: Creates initial spec structure from description only
2. **handleRequirementsSimplified**: Generates EARS requirements from spec context
3. **handleDesignSimplified**: Creates technical design with phase validation  
4. **handleTasksSimplified**: Generates kiro-style numbered tasks with validation

### Phase Validation Logic
- **Requirements**: No prerequisites (can run after init)
- **Design**: Validates `spec.approvals.requirements.generated = true`
- **Tasks**: Validates `spec.approvals.design.generated = true`
- Auto-updates phase tracking in spec.json

## Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Initialize from description (works in empty directory)
sdd-init "A CLI tool that analyzes code quality and provides automated refactoring suggestions"
# → Creates: .kiro/specs/cli-tool-that-analyzes/{spec.json, requirements.md}

# 2. Generate requirements (uses spec context)
sdd-requirements cli-tool-that-analyzes  
# → Updates: requirements.md with EARS format, spec.json phase tracking

# 3. Create design (validates requirements phase)
sdd-design cli-tool-that-analyzes
# → Creates: design.md with architecture, updates phase tracking

# 4. Generate tasks (validates design phase) 
sdd-tasks cli-tool-that-analyzes
# → Creates: tasks.md with numbered implementation plan, sets ready_for_implementation
```

## Empty Project Support
✅ **Works without package.json**: All content generated from project description
✅ **No existing files required**: Bootstraps completely from scratch
✅ **Progressive enhancement**: Builds context through each phase
✅ **Spec-driven approach**: Uses accumulated specification knowledge

## EARS Format Implementation
Requirements now use proper Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax:
- WHEN [event/condition] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
- IF [precondition] THEN [system] SHALL [response]  
- WHILE [ongoing condition] THE [system] SHALL [behavior]
- WHERE [location/context] THE [system] SHALL [behavior]

## File Structure Created
```
.kiro/
└── specs/
    └── [feature-name]/
        ├── spec.json          # Metadata, phase tracking, approvals
        ├── requirements.md    # EARS-formatted requirements  
        ├── design.md         # Technical design document
        └── tasks.md          # Implementation task breakdown
```

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Bootstrap Capability**: Works from empty projects without existing files
2. **Context-Aware Generation**: Creates project-specific content, not templates
3. **Phase Enforcement**: Validates workflow progression and dependencies
4. **Kiro Alignment**: Matches kiro command patterns exactly
5. **Scalable Structure**: Proper spec management for multiple features

## Testing Verification
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Code structure review confirms kiro workflow alignment
- ✅ Empty project scenario designed and validated  
- ✅ Tool schemas updated for consistency
- ✅ Phase validation logic implemented correctly

This implementation successfully transforms the MCP tools from static template generators to dynamic, context-aware specification builders that can bootstrap from nothing and build incrementally through a validated workflow.
