# Requirements Document

## Introduction
The MCP SDD Server enables spec-driven development (SDD) workflows across any MCP-compatible AI agent CLI or IDE by providing structured development tools and project context management. Based on the cc-sdd methodology, this server transforms ad-hoc AI-assisted coding into systematic, production-ready development processes with built-in quality gates and code review standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: MCP Protocol Compliance and Multi-Client Support
**Objective:** As a developer using any MCP-compatible AI agent or IDE, I want to access SDD functionality through standardized MCP protocols, so that I can use the same structured development approach regardless of my chosen AI tool.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN an MCP client connects to the server THEN the SDD Server SHALL implement the MCP protocol specification
2. WHEN a client requests available tools THEN the SDD Server SHALL provide a complete list of SDD workflow tools
3. WHEN multiple clients connect simultaneously THEN the SDD Server SHALL maintain independent project contexts for each client session
4. IF a client supports Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Amazon Q CLI, or Codex CLI THEN the SDD Server SHALL provide full functionality without compatibility issues
5. WHEN a client disconnects unexpectedly THEN the SDD Server SHALL persist project state and allow reconnection without data loss

### Requirement 2: Spec-Driven Development Workflow Management
**Objective:** As a developer, I want to follow a structured SDD workflow from requirements to implementation, so that I can ensure code quality and maintainability throughout the development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user initiates a new project THEN the SDD Server SHALL provide tools for project context establishment
2. WHEN requirements are defined THEN the SDD Server SHALL validate completeness and store them for reference
3. WHEN design specifications are created THEN the SDD Server SHALL ensure they align with approved requirements
4. WHEN tasks are broken down THEN the SDD Server SHALL verify they cover all design elements
5. WHEN implementation begins THEN the SDD Server SHALL provide task tracking and progress monitoring
6. IF any workflow phase is incomplete THEN the SDD Server SHALL prevent progression to subsequent phases
7. WHILE development is active THE SDD Server SHALL maintain project memory and context across sessions

### Requirement 3: Project Context and Memory Management
**Objective:** As a developer working on complex projects, I want the AI to maintain comprehensive project understanding across sessions, so that development recommendations remain consistent and contextually appropriate.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a project is initialized THEN the SDD Server SHALL analyze codebase structure and dependencies
2. WHEN code changes are made THEN the SDD Server SHALL update project context automatically
3. WHERE project steering files exist THE SDD Server SHALL incorporate them into all development decisions
4. WHEN a user queries project status THEN the SDD Server SHALL provide current state across all workflow phases
5. IF project context becomes stale THEN the SDD Server SHALL prompt for context refresh
6. WHILE processing requests THE SDD Server SHALL apply accumulated project knowledge to recommendations

### Requirement 4: Code Quality and Review Integration
**Objective:** As a development team, I want automated code quality enforcement based on established standards, so that all generated code meets consistent quality criteria and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN code is generated THEN the SDD Server SHALL apply Linus-style review criteria automatically
2. WHEN reviewing code THEN the SDD Server SHALL provide taste scoring (Good/Passable/Garbage) with specific feedback
3. IF code violates simplicity standards THEN the SDD Server SHALL suggest refactoring before approval
4. WHEN design patterns are complex THEN the SDD Server SHALL propose simpler alternatives
5. WHERE special cases exist THE SDD Server SHALL recommend data structure improvements to eliminate them
6. WHILE reviewing changes THE SDD Server SHALL ensure backward compatibility is maintained

### Requirement 5: Multi-Language and Cross-Platform Support
**Objective:** As a global development team, I want to use SDD workflows in my preferred language and development environment, so that language barriers don't impede structured development adoption.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a client specifies language preference THEN the SDD Server SHALL provide responses in English, Japanese, or Traditional Chinese
2. WHERE platform-specific tooling is required THE SDD Server SHALL support macOS, Linux, and Windows environments
3. WHEN generating project templates THEN the SDD Server SHALL adapt to detected operating system conventions
4. IF language-specific best practices apply THEN the SDD Server SHALL incorporate them into quality reviews
5. WHEN documentation is created THEN the SDD Server SHALL maintain consistency with selected language and locale

### Requirement 6: TypeScript Implementation and Extensibility
**Objective:** As a maintainer of the SDD Server, I want a robust TypeScript codebase with clear extension points, so that the server can be enhanced and customized for specific organizational needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the server is implemented THEN the SDD Server SHALL be built using TypeScript with full type safety
2. WHEN new tools are added THEN the SDD Server SHALL support plugin architecture for custom extensions
3. WHERE configuration is needed THE SDD Server SHALL provide JSON-based configuration with schema validation
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the SDD Server SHALL provide detailed, typed error responses to MCP clients
5. IF custom steering documents are added THEN the SDD Server SHALL dynamically load and apply them
6. WHILE serving requests THE SDD Server SHALL maintain performance standards suitable for interactive development

### Requirement 7: SDD Template and File Management
**Objective:** As a developer starting SDD workflows, I want standardized templates and automatic file generation for all SDD phases, so that I can maintain consistent project structure and documentation standards across all projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a project is initialized THEN the SDD Server SHALL create `.kiro/steering/`, `.kiro/specs/`, and `.claude/commands/` directory structures
2. WHEN steering files are requested THEN the SDD Server SHALL provide templates for `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`, and custom steering documents
3. WHEN a new spec is created THEN the SDD Server SHALL generate `spec.json`, `requirements.md` templates with proper metadata structure
4. WHERE design phase is initiated THE SDD Server SHALL create `design.md` template with architecture and component sections
5. WHEN task breakdown occurs THEN the SDD Server SHALL generate `tasks.md` with implementation checklist format
6. IF custom templates are needed THEN the SDD Server SHALL support template customization and organization-specific formats
7. WHILE managing templates THE SDD Server SHALL ensure all generated files follow consistent formatting and include required metadata

### Requirement 8: Tool Integration and Command Interface
**Objective:** As a developer using AI-assisted development, I want access to comprehensive SDD commands through my chosen AI interface, so that I can leverage structured development without learning new tools or interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a client requests SDD tools THEN the SDD Server SHALL provide equivalents to all 10 cc-sdd slash commands
2. WHEN project initialization is requested THEN the SDD Server SHALL create appropriate directory structures and template files
3. WHERE requirements definition is needed THE SDD Server SHALL provide structured templates and EARS format validation
4. WHEN design specifications are created THEN the SDD Server SHALL ensure traceability to requirements and generate design templates
5. IF task breakdown is requested THEN the SDD Server SHALL generate actionable implementation steps in standardized task format
6. WHILE implementation proceeds THE SDD Server SHALL track completion status and dependencies using task templates
7. WHEN quality gates are reached THEN the SDD Server SHALL enforce approval workflows before progression using template-based checkpoints
