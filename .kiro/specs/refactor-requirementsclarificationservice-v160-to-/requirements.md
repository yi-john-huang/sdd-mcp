# Requirements Document

## Project Description (Input)
Refactor RequirementsClarificationService (v1.6.0) to address code review findings. Split God Class into 5 focused components: DescriptionAnalyzer (pure analysis logic), QuestionGenerator (template-based question creation), DescriptionEnricher (transformation logic), SteeringContextLoader (I/O abstraction), and RequirementsClarificationService (orchestrator). Consolidate duplicate logic across three implementations (service, adapter, MCP server). Replace brittle regex pattern matching with scoring-based semantic detection. Extract hardcoded questions to questions.json configuration. Add comprehensive integration tests. Improve error handling with typed errors. Maintain backward compatibility with existing v1.5.0 API.
