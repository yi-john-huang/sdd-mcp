# Product Overview

## Product Description
MCP SDD Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that implements Spec-Driven Development (SDD) workflows for AI-agent CLIs and IDEs. It provides a structured, phase-driven approach to software development that ensures quality and consistency across AI-assisted development sessions.

## Core Features
- **5-Phase SDD Workflow**: INIT → REQUIREMENTS → DESIGN → TASKS → IMPLEMENTATION
- **Quality Enforcement**: Linus Torvalds-style 5-layer code review system
- **Multi-Language Support**: 10 languages with cultural adaptation
- **Template Engine**: Handlebars-based file generation for consistent project structure
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom workflows and tools
- **MCP Protocol Compatibility**: Full integration with Claude Code, Cursor, and other MCP clients
- **Quality Gates**: Approval-based workflow progression with validation checkpoints
- **Project Context Management**: Persistent project state and memory across sessions
- **Code Analysis**: AST-based analysis for structural quality assessment
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Global npm installation, Docker, and local development options

## Target Use Cases

### Primary Use Case: AI-Assisted Development
- **Problem**: AI agents often lack project context and structured development processes
- **Solution**: Provides persistent project memory and enforced development workflows
- **Benefit**: Consistent, high-quality code generation with proper architectural consideration

### Secondary Use Cases
- **Team Development**: Standardized development processes across human and AI contributors
- **Code Quality Assurance**: Automated quality gates and review processes
- **Project Documentation**: Auto-generated requirements, design, and task documentation
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Consistent workflows across different IDEs and AI tools

## Key Value Proposition

### For AI Development
- **Structured Context**: Maintains project knowledge across development sessions
- **Quality Assurance**: Prevents AI-generated code from lacking architectural consideration
- **Process Enforcement**: Ensures requirements → design → implementation workflow
- **Code Standards**: Applies Linus Torvalds-style quality principles to AI-generated code

### For Development Teams
- **Consistency**: Standardized development processes regardless of human or AI contributor
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated and maintained project documentation
- **Quality Gates**: Prevent progression without proper review and approval
- **Flexibility**: Plugin system allows customization for specific team needs

## Success Metrics
- **Workflow Compliance**: Projects following full SDD process show higher code quality
- **Context Retention**: AI agents maintain project understanding across sessions
- **Quality Scores**: Linus-style review scores improve with SDD adoption
- **Development Speed**: Structured workflows reduce rework and debugging time

## Competitive Advantages
- **MCP Protocol Native**: Built specifically for AI-agent integration
- **Quality-First Approach**: Linus Torvalds principles embedded in workflow
- **Pragmatic Design**: Solves real AI development problems, not theoretical ones
- **Extensible Architecture**: Plugin system allows community and enterprise customization
