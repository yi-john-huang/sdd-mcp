# AGENTS.md — Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

This project uses the SDD workflow powered by `sdd-mcp-server`.

## Development Paths

### Simple Tasks
For small features, bug fixes, and quick enhancements — just start coding with best practices.

### Full SDD Workflow
For complex features requiring formal specification:

```
Initialize → Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implement
```

Each phase builds on the previous and requires review before proceeding.

## Installed Components

The SDD components are stored in `.claude/` directories. Read the referenced files for full details.
